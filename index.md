# About

Living organisms intertwine soft (e.g., muscle) and hard (e.g., bones) materials, giving them an intrinsic flexibility and resiliency often lacking in conventional rigid robots. The emerging field of soft robotics seeks to harness these same properties to create resilient machines. 

Tensegrities are relatively simple mechanical systems, consisting of a number of rigid elements (struts) joined at their endpoints by tensile elements (cables or springs), and kept stable through a synergistic interplay of prestress forces. Beyond engineering, properties of tensegrity have been demonstrated at all scales of the natural world, ranging from the tendinous network of the human hand to the mechanotransduction of living cells. At every size, tensegrity structures exhibit two interesting features: they have an impressive strength-to-weight ratio and they are structurally robust and stable in the face of deformation. Moreover, unlike many other soft robots, tensegrity structures are inherently modular (consisting of only struts and springs) and are, therefore, relatively easy to construct. They are simple enough to be baby toys and featured in books for children activities, whereas complex enough to serve as the basis for the next generation of NASA's planetary rovers.
